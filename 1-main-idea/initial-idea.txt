# Main Idea

## Initial Concept:
disruption-greencoin professional presentation

## Development Notes:
- Created: 2025-08-30T23:39:40.901Z
- Status: Initial concept
- Next Steps: Expand into comprehensive analysis

## Key Questions to Address:
1. What problem does this solve?
	- Bridges conservation funding gaps by tokenizing natural heritage (biodiversity/DNA data) into a digital asset (GreenCoin), aligning incentives for institutions, students, and campus vendors.

2. Who is the target audience?
	- Initial: UTEC ecosystem (students, campus stores, faculty/admin) and partner institutions (e.g., Huachipa Zoo). Later: conservation orgs and broader crypto-curious supporters.
3. What are the expected outcomes?
	- Launch a pilot blockchain on UTEC network; mint initial 5 GreenCoins backed by verifiable biological information; enable fractional ownership and on-campus payments; establish data-collection collaboration (DNA sampling, electrophoresis at UTEC, Sanger sequencing via US lab).
4. How will success be measured?
	- Primary KPI: number of vendor redemptions (store owners exchanging tokens for cash). Secondary: minted coins count, student adoption (fractional purchases), partner participation, and transaction volume on the chain.
