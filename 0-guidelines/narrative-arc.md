# Narrative Arc Design
    
## Story Spine
Based on initial idea: "disruption-greencoin professional presentation"

### Structure:
- **Once upon a time...** [Context/Current State]
- **Every day...** [Normal operations/status quo]
- **Until one day...** [Problem/Challenge emerges]
- **Because of that...** [Consequences and implications]
- **Finally...** [Solution and transformation]

### Emotional Beats:
1. **Opening Hook** - Capture attention
2. **Building Tension** - Establish stakes
3. **Climax** - Present solution
4. **Resolution** - Show outcomes
5. **Call to Action** - Next steps

## Engagement Points:
- Interactive elements
- Audience participation moments
- Visual reveals
- Data-driven insights
